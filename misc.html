          <p>I was given the oppurtunity to create a share icon for one of our teams. I started brainstorming out some new designs that. I ended with three versions. The first is a simplified version of our current sharing icon seen elsewhere in app. This icon is my top choice as it maintains consistency with our what icons we use to signify certain actions. I created two other verisons for the team. A version using an arrow as that is a common aspect of many share icons and another using a filled version of the share connected dots. The created icon will be implemented with a new feature beign released later this year. I included a view of the icon in situ as it will be viewed in app. </p>

                <h3 class="my-3">User Activation Email</h3>
                <p>The current email sent to clients to activate their portal is unformatted text. We used to have a well designed html based email that received feedback about being too colorful and sales-focused for clients. For that reason they removed almost all color but the 'activate now' button. Feedback on this version was that it looks too informal and even that it looks like a scam email. I tried to find a happy medium between the two by keeping to a small color palette while changing the language so it doesnt seem sales-focused while also keeping it in a properly formated html based email that looks professional. I have presented this new design to the Product Manager but it has not been implemented yet.</p>

                <p>Collecting internal product feedback never had a home. It would be slacked, emailed, g-chated, and even written down and scanned for the porduct team. I approached our Director of Product and piched the Advice box as a way to collect and store all internal product feedback, and she loved it! I expanded the project to include contact elimination sugesstions for customer facing teams and a UI imporvement section where they could point out oppurtunities for imporvment that may be minor enough to not show in user feedback. The Advice box has been a success with daily entries added.  </p>

                <p>I had the ambitious goal to write my own portfolio instead of using a generic template from one of the many drag and drop website editors. To achieve this I took the codecademy courses on HTML and CSS. I started using the jekyll framework but quickly (or not so quickly) realised it was not a fit for what I wanted to achieve so I looked at what design challenges I could not complete using that and began searching for another. I ended up using the bootstrap framework since I am familiar with it and it is just so trendy right now! I have poured countless hours into making sure everything looks as good as possible for my coding level and designed what I felt is a great user experience. </p>
