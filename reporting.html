          <p>The reporting feature was designed to provide detailed metrics and information rapidly to get a glimpse on business health and financials. We observed that the service was not delivering rapid or relevant reports causing users to utilize other software to satisfy this need. How might we improve reporting so that our existing and new customers are successful using the feature? We will heave achieved this when we see a reduction in case volume and a visible increase in report interaction.</p>

                    <p>By improving the local navigation and highlighting reports to show most useful items first we can hopefully boost overall adoption and usage of the feature. We validated the need for this change through customer feedback seen in surveys and in the  suggestion box in app. The goal is to increase product stickiness by offering a feature that they could not find elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>I began by creating a list of most used reports from the usage metrics I have available to me. From there I want to identify a workflow that users have when using reports do they run report a and report b after? Using Mixpanel and Pendo to collect this data and create funnels to see where users dropped off when using reports. Once I had identified the usage of reporting feature and the functionality available with our integrations i began sketching out ideas.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Reporting was designed to achieve detailed yet rapid metrics on firm health and financials. We have observed that the product isn’t meeting the goal of delivering rapid metrics, which is causing users to utilize other reporting software reducing overall adoption of the working aspects of reporting causing an increase in cases on front facing teams. How might we improve reporting so that our customers are more successful based on reduction in case volume and increase in report interaction?</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>We believe a reporting dashboard and customizable firm metrics along with a reorganized reporting tab will boost feature adoption and increase customer satisfaction. We will know we’re right when we see interaction metrics with reporting increase and case volume marked as reporting decreases.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>This project started as a small quick win to reorganize the reporting tab dropdown to show more reports instead of different quick filters of the same two reports. There is space for 8 different reports and it is being utilized for 4 at this time. I began by looking in Pendo, which we user to track clicks and feature usage to see what reports get the most traffic. Unsurprising, the 4 reports listed get a good amount of traffic. However, some reports that are not on this list are used the most. Why make the user have to go to another page to view their most used report when it could be one click away?</p>

                <p class="text-danger">Since this was a big overhaul both in look and functionality I had to imagine the possibility of what it could be. I began by understanding the user journey through research with customers. After that I mapped out what the current state was and what the future version could be.</p> 
                <p class="text-danger">After I had an idea of where I wanted to go I was able to sketch out several low-fidelity wireframes that illustrated the functionality the users needed. From there I began working in sketch and testing with proto-users and internal stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="text-danger">Overall this project was a success. One lesson I learned on this project was the input of team members who helped ground me when I would show them Ideas that were not feasible to build. The value of iteration helped me run with feasible ideas and find the best aspects of others to combine into a best version. By the time this project was completed I had created a pile of sketches and wireframes. Moving forward I will rely more on internal feedback from the team to help keep my ideas grounded and feasible with our sprint cycles.</p>
