          <p>Batch billing was designed to achieve rapid invoicing for multiple matters while giving users the ability to adjust in bulk. We observed that the service isnt meeting the goal to allow the user to adjust their bills adequately and is not accessible to new users, which is causing many support cases and product feedback requests to improve the feature. How might we improve batch billing so that our customers are more successful based on increased usage of the feature and reduced call volume to the customer service team.</p>

                  </h4>
                    <p>Users are not saving time by batch billing, they find the feature lacking assumed functionality and because of the the poor UI, they need constant guidance from our customer success team. Also new customers find it overwhelming, if they can even find the feature. Goal is to redesign the batch billing to allow for expanded functionality and improve accessibility for both new and current users.</p>

                    <p>I worked closely with the front facing teams to understand the customer’s workflow and mindset to create a framework for the feature. I continually iterated my ideas based on user data from observational/ usability calls, and discovered patterns on requested functionality.  Working with the team in SD, I created Sketch mockups and high-fidelity prototypes via InVision to test with customers.</p>

                <p class="text-warning">This project was presented to the entire team once completed and I was able to get valuable feedback about how to break it into smaller iterations that allow it to fit comfortably with their sprint cycles. Since there is no availability to assign this project to one team it will be used to satisfy “quick wins” over many sprint cycles. Applying credit to batched invoices was recently launched and there has been a lot of feedback from users about how happy they are that we implemented this.</p>

   <!-- Problem Statement --> 
            <div>
                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>The batch billing feature provides a way to rapidly invoice many matters at a time. From the constant support cases and negative feedback, the current design falls short in allowing our users to batch bill and make adjustments with confidence, especially with new users. The goal is to improve batch billing so that our customers are more successful based on increased usage of the feature and reduced call volume to the customer service team.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>We believe that creating an efficient billing system within Mycase’s product experience for users will achieve a higher rate of invoice creation and a reduction in call volume to CS. We will know this is true when we see an increase in product satisfaction, batch invoice creation, and a decrease in reported calls on the topic from CS.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>I utilized multiple research projects on while in discovery and in parallel to the development of the feature. I employed usability tests with internal stakeholders, gathered competitive intelligence on how current competitors handled batch billing, and prototyping sessions with pseudo-users. All while gathering intel and asking current users on their expectations and needs throughout. Researching the payment experience was a massive undertaking. We accumulated data from 128 connected calls with current payment users. I Conducted expert interviews with CS reps and other members of user facing teams including payments, sales, and training/onboarding.  </p>

                    <p>Data was tallied and broken down by practice area for more insights into the needs by more narrow user groupings. These results were then shown graphically to the team. From this data I was able to see that our users were not using for a few reasons and that many of these reasons were rooted in their practice area. </p>

                <h3>Defining the Experience</h3>
                <p>Since this was a big overhaul both in look and functionality I had to imagine the possibility of what it could be. I began by understanding the user journey through research with customers. Using the Payment profiles developed I was able to see what user type was hurting most from the current iteration and where they needed change to eliminate that pain. After I had mapped out what the current state was and what the future version could be I began wireframing ideas.</p> 
                <p class="text-warning">After I had an idea I wanted to test it with CS reps and other internal team members to see how they would interact with the prototype and see what feedback I could generate. Once I received some feedback from the teams I was able to sketch out several low-fidelity wireframes that illustrated more accurately the functionality the users needed. From there I began working with a product team to review my sketchs and have them begin testing the feasibility of developing and further testing with users and stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="text-warning">The Lean UX methodology helped heavily in how I tackled this project. Going in with a mindset willing to experiment helped in rapidly out putting mocks of ideas. Using the scientific method to help isolate specific user needs and make hypotheses to develop solutions for them. As we continue to build new features and expand on current ones I will remain lean and agile.</p>

                <h3>From, To &amp; Lessons Learned </h3>
                <p class="text-warning">Overall this project was a success. One lesson I learned on this project was that I need to get input of team members regularly to ground me when I would show them Ideas that were not feasible to build. The value of iteration helped me run with feasible ideas and find the best aspects of others to combine into a best version without wasting resources focusing on one idea for too long before having to pivot. By the time this project was completed I had created a pile of sketches and wireframes. Moving forward I will rely more on internal feedback from the team to help keep my ideas grounded and feasible with our sprint cycles.</p>
